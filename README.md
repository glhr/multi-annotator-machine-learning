**Motivation:** 
- Default (DEF): Benchmarking learning from crowds approaches with default hyperparameters is realistic but leads to an unfair comparison of suboptimal performances.
- Default (TRUE): Benchmarking learning from crowds approaches with hyperparameters optimized via a validation set with ground truth class labels leads to a fair comparison with much better performances but is unrealistic.
- Both benchmarks lead to different rankings of the learning from crowds approaches.

**Goal:** Enable a fairer and more realistic benchmark of learning from crowds approaches by optimizing their hyperparameters with access only to crowd-labeled training and validation data.

## Setup of Conda Environment :snake:
As a prerequisite, we assume that we have a Linux distribution as an operating system. 

1. Download a [`conda`](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) version to be installed on your machine. 
2. Set up the environment via
```bash
projectpath$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```
As a fallback in the case of any issues with the previous installation, we also provie a 
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file, which lists all manually installed Python packages:
```bash
projectpath$ conda create -n crowd-hpo python=3.9
projectpath$ conda activate crowd-hpo
projectpath$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In both cases, keep in mind to adjust the [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) related packages
according to your hardware.
3. Activate the new environment
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd-hpo
```
4. Verify that the `crowd-hpo` environment was installed correctly:
```bash
projectpath$ conda env list
```

## Experimental Study :bar_chart:

We provide scripts and a Jupyter notebook to benchmark and visualize learning from crowds approaches in combination
with hyperparameter optimization with crowd-labeled validation data on real-world dataset variants labeled by noisy 
human crowdworkers. 

### Experiments 
The Python script for executing a single experiment is 
[`perform_experiment.py`](empirical_evaluation/python_scripts/perform_experiment.py) and the corresponding main config file 
is [`evaluation`](empirical_evaluation/hydra_configs/experiment.yaml). In this config file, you also need to specify the `mlruns_path` 
defining the path, where the results are to be saved via [`mlflow`](https://mlflow.org/). Further, you have the option
to select the 'gpu' or 'cpu' as `accelerator`.
1. Before starting a single experiment or Jupyter notebook, check whether all datasets are already downloaded. 
For example, if you want to ensure that the dataset `music_genres` is downloaded, update the `download` flag in its config 
file [`music_genres.yaml`](empirical_evaluation/hydra_configs/data/music_genres.yaml).
2. An experiment can then be started by executing the following commands
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd-hpo
projectpath$ cd empirical_evaluation/python_scripts
projectpath/empirical_evaluation/python_scripts$ python perform_experiment.py \
    data=music_genres \
    data.class_definition.variant="full" \
    classifier=coin_net \
    seed=0 \
    data.class_definition.download=True \
    architecture=tabnet_music_genres \
    ssl_model=none
````
3. Since there are many different experimental configurations, including five repetitions with different seeds, you can
create Bash scripts by following the instructions in [`write_bash_scripts.py`](empirical_evaluation/python_scripts/write_bash_scripts.py) and then
execute the following commands
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd-hpo
projectpath$ cd empirical_evaluation/python_scripts
projectpath/empirical_evaluation/python_scripts$ python write_bash_scripts.py
```
4. There is a bash script for the HPS, the default data-agnostic HPC, and the default data-specific HPC for each dataset variant of the benchmark. For 
example, executing the HPS for the dataset variant `mgc-full` via SLURM can be done according to
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd-hpo
projectpath$ sbatch path_to_bash_scripts/hyperparameter_search_music_genres_full_part1.sh
projectpath$ sbatch path_to_bash_scripts/hyperparameter_search_music_genres_full_part2.sh
projectpath$ sbatch path_to_bash_scripts/hyperparameter_search_music_genres_full_part3.sh
projectpath$ sbatch path_to_bash_scripts/hyperparameter_search_music_genres_full_part4.sh
```

### Results
Once all experiments are completed, their associated results can be loaded via [`mlflow`](https://mlflow.org/). 
To get a full presentation of these results, you need to start the Jupyter notebook 
[`analyze_results.ipynb`](empirical_evaluation/jupyter_notebooks/analyze_results.ipynb) and follow its instructions.
```bash
projectpath$ conda activate crowd-hpo
projectpath$ cd empirical_evaluation/jupyter_notebooks
projectpath/empirical_evaluation/jupyter_notebooks$ jupyter-notebook analyze_results.ipynb
```
